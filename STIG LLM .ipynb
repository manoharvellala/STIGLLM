      "\n",
      "1. Checks if the file `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config` exists. If it does, it removes any existing lines starting with `MACs`.\n",
      "2. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.\n",
      "3. It adds a newline at the end of the file.\n",
      "4. It creates a backup of the original file.\n",
      "5. It inserts the approved values for SSHD MACs at the end of the file.\n",
      "6. Finally, it removes the backup file.\n",

It also checks for the presence of the `/org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard/removal-action` key in the `/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks` directory, and if it's not present, it adds it.

      "This script is designed to remediate the STIG rule \"xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_dconf_gnome_screensaver_idle_delay\". The script sets the inactivity timeout value to 900 seconds (15 minutes) in the GNOME screensaver settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The script first checks if the `gdm` package is installed and if the script is running in a container or Docker environment. If these conditions are met, the script proceeds with the remediation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The script then sets the inactivity timeout value to 900 seconds and checks if there are any existing settings files in the `/etc/dconf/db/local.d` directory. If there are, the script comments out any existing `idle-delay` settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The script then creates a new file called `00-security-settings` in the `/etc/dconf/db/local.d` directory if it does not already exist. It then adds the `idle-delay` setting to this file with the value of 900 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the script updates the DConf database using the `dconf update` command.\n",
      "\n",

      "This remediation script is written in bash and uses the DConf configuration file to set the `lock-enabled` key to `true`. It checks for existing settings in the DConf db directories and comments out any existing settings. It then sets the default value of `lock-enabled` to `true` if it is not already set. Finally, it applies the configuration to all enabled systems using `dconf update`. The script also handles the case where the `lock-enabled` key is already set to `true` by skipping the modification step. The script is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing unintended consequences. It also checks for the presence of the `gdm` package and the `docker` and `container` environment variables before attempting to apply the remediation. If the remediation is not applicable, it will print a message indicating that nothing was done.\n",

      "### Remediation Explanation:\n",
      "This script sets the `localpkg_gpgcheck` parameter in the `/etc/yum.conf` file to ensure that the GPG check is enabled for local packages. The script first checks if the parameter already exists in the file. If it does, it updates the value to `1`. If it does not, it adds the parameter to the file with the value `1`. The script also handles the case where the `/etc/yum.conf` file does not exist or is empty. In this case, it creates a new line at the end of the file and adds the parameter with the value `1`. The script uses `sed` and `grep` commands to manipulate the file and ensure that the parameter is set correctly. The `CCE-80791-7` identifier is used to track the remediation. The script is designed to be safe and idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing harm or producing unexpected results.\n",
